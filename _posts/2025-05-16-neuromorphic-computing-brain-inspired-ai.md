- **Energy inefficiency**: GPUs consume massive amounts of power for training and inference
- **Von Neumann bottleneck**: Traditional architectures struggle with the parallel operations needed for neural networks
- **Centralized processing**: Cloud-based AI limits applications requiring real-time, low-latency processing

## Neuromorphic Chips: Computing Like a Brain

Neuromorphic systems take inspiration from neuroscience to create fundamentally different computing architectures:

### Key Architectural Innovations

These brain-inspired designs incorporate several revolutionary elements:

- **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**: Event-based processing that activates only when needed
- **In-memory computing**: Eliminating the separation between processing and memory
- **Massively parallel architecture**: Processing thousands of operations simultaneously with dedicated neural circuits
