# Welcome to my first post!

## What I've learned

- How to set up a Jekyll site with a modern design
- How to customize layouts and styles for a professional look
- How to incorporate modern UI elements and responsive design
- How to publish to GitHub Pages with automated workflows

### Code Example

Here's how you might add a new post to your Jekyll site:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your New Post Title"
date: 2025-05-22 12:00:00 -0000
categories: jekyll update
---

# Welcome to your new post!

This is the content of your post.
```

### Images and Media

Jekyll makes it easy to include images and other media in your posts. You can store them in an assets folder and reference them with relative URLs.

## Next Steps

Here are some ideas for what to explore next:

1. Add custom domains to your GitHub Pages site
2. Implement Jekyll collections for custom content types
3. Create custom page layouts for different sections of your site
4. Add comments with a service like Disqus
